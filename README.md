# Lost In Space: an adventure game

# About the game 
Iâ€™ve been watching Lost In Space on Netflix and thought it would be fun to create a space game
where the user explores a game universe moving between planets, dodge things, collecting coins,
getting power-ups, etc. There is also a time limit where they are aiming to find a destination
planet, with limited fuel. This way there is the trade off between reading the goal and improving your
score.
